## What is an image?

Seeing as a container is an isolated process, where does it get its files and configuration? How do you share those environments?

That's where container images come in. 

A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container.

For a PostgreSQL image, that image will package the database binaries, config files, and other dependencies.

For a Python web app, it'll include the Python runtime, your app code, and all of its dependencies.

There are two important principles of images:

1- Images are immutable.
  - Once an image is created, it can't be modified.
  - You can only make a new image or add changes on top of it.

2- Container images are composed of layers.
  - Each layer represents a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files.


These two principles let you to extend or add to existing images. 

For example, if you are building a Python app, you can start from the Python image and add additional layers to install your app's dependencies and add your code.

This lets you focus on your app, rather than Python itself.

### Finding images

Docker Hub is the default global marketplace for storing and distributing images.

 It has over 100,000 images created by developers that you can run locally.

 You can search for Docker Hub images and run them directly from Docker Desktop.

 #### Search for and download an image
 
Follow the instructions to search and pull a Docker image using CLI to view its layers.

1- Open a terminal and search for images using the `docker search` command:

```bash
docker search docker/welcome-to-docker
```

You will see output like the following:

```bash
NAME                       DESCRIPTION                                     STARS     OFFICIAL
docker/welcome-to-docker   Docker image for new users getting started w…   20
```

This output shows you information about relevant images available on Docker Hub.

2- Pull the image using the `docker pull` command.

```bash
docker pull docker/welcome-to-docker
```

You will see output like the following:

```bash

latest: Pulling from docker/welcome-to-docker

Status: Downloaded newer image for docker/welcome-to-docker:latest
docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker:latest
```

Each of line represents a different downloaded layer of the image. Remember that each layer is a set of filesystem changes and provides functionality of the image.

#### Learn about the image

1- List your downloaded images using the `docker image ls` command:

```bash
docker image ls
```
You will see output like the following:

```bash
REPOSITORY                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
docker/welcome-to-docker   latest    eedaff45e3c7   4 months ago   29.7MB
```

The command shows a list of Docker images currently available on your system. The `docker/welcome-to-docker` has a total size of approximately 29.7MB.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The image size represented here reflects the uncompressed size of the image, not the download size of the layers.


2- List the image's layers using the `docker image history` command:

```bash
docker image history docker/welcome-to-docker
```

You will see output like the following:

```bash

```

This output shows you all of the layers, their sizes, and the command used to create the layer.

>[!NOTE]
> If you add the `--no-trunc` flag to the command, you will see the full command.
> Note that, since the output is in a table-like format, longer commands will cause the output to be very difficult to navigate.
